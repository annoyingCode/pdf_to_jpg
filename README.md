# PDF to JPG
This repository contains code to convert PDF files to JPG (or any other image format). I created this to convert my Coursera PDF files to JPG Files so I can display them on my portfolio. It also uses Flask. Feel free to use the code for your use case.

You will need the following librariy and tool to successfully run the code.
1. [pdf2image](https://pypi.org/project/pdf2image/)
2. (https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows)
